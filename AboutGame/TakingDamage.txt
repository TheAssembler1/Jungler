##RULES FOR TAKING DAMAGE OR GIVING DAMAGE##

Node or object recieving giving damage should detect the collision and only take health from the other.
You should have a variable called attack_damage.
Then use area.get_parent.object_health.
Then just substract this result from your attack_damage value.
The node hitting you should have a variable called attack_damage. Just subtract your health from this variable.
Player has an attack_damage variable unique to each node that can give damage.
Please use that variable to substract from the objects health that is receiving the damage.
